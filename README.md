- 👋 Hi, I’m @Boovtech. My real name is Virginia.  Boov are purple aliens that like to eat electronics.  They help me keep things neat around here by eating old parts and other junk.  I am an amateur radio operator - NV5F - and an EE student in Fort Worth, Texas.
- 👀 I’m interested in radio communications, anything to do with space and space program history.  I love science fiction and art.  I am an artist and a musician.  My favorite movie is "Short Circuit."  ANd my favorite band is ELO!  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of electrical engineering... includng a lot of math!  I have done some simple radio and circuit board design and will hopefully start some circuits classes soon. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on RF design and satellite projects which are accessible to someone at my level.  I am currently building the AMSAT CubeSat Simulator.
- 📫 How to reach me...  Best way to get me is via email virginia@pipertoo.com
